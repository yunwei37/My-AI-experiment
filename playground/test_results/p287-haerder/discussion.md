# PhD Paper Discussion Questions

## Student 1: Interested in Database Systems

### High-Level Question
**How does the terminological framework introduced by Haerder and Reuter influence the future design and scalability of transaction-oriented recovery systems in modern DBMS?**

*Guidance:* Consider the long-term implications of having a unified vocabulary on the evolution of database systems. Reflect on how clear terminology can aid in the development of more scalable and maintainable recovery mechanisms.

### Low-Level Question
**In what ways do the different logging techniques classified in the paper (physical state logging, physical transition logging, and logical transition logging) impact the performance and reliability of recovery processes in current database architectures?**

*Guidance:* Analyze the specific advantages and drawbacks of each logging technique. Discuss how these methods affect system performance during normal operations and during recovery scenarios.

## Student 2: Interested in Machine Learning Systems (MLsys)

### High-Level Question
**Can the principles of transaction-oriented database recovery presented in the paper be adapted to enhance the fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms in distributed machine learning training pipelines?**

*Guidance:* Explore the parallels between database transaction recovery and fault tolerance in ML systems. Consider how concepts like logging and checkpointing might improve the resilience of ML workflows.

### Low-Level Question
**How might the classification scheme for logging techniques influence the implementation of reproducibility features in machine learning experiments?**

*Guidance:* Examine the role of logging in ensuring that ML experiments can be reliably reproduced. Discuss how different logging strategies could support or hinder reproducibility efforts.

## Student 3: Interested in Architecture/Operating Systems

### High-Level Question
**What are the potential interactions between transaction-oriented recovery mechanisms in DBMS and the underlying operating system’s memory management and storage subsystems?**

*Guidance:* Investigate how DBMS recovery processes rely on or interact with OS-level features. Consider aspects like virtual memory, file systems, and I/O scheduling in the context of database recovery.

### Low-Level Question
**How do checkpoint types (transaction-consistent, action-consistent, fuzzy) align with modern CPU caching strategies and memory consistency models in contemporary computer architectures?**

*Guidance:* Analyze how different types of checkpoints interact with CPU caches and memory models. Discuss the implications for system performance and consistency during recovery.

## Student 4: Interested in Distributed Systems/Networks

### High-Level Question
**How can the taxonomy for transaction-oriented recovery schemes be extended or modified to address challenges specific to distributed database systems, such as network partitions and latency?**

*Guidance:* Consider the complexities introduced by distribution, such as synchronization and coordination among nodes. Discuss how the existing taxonomy might need to evolve to accommodate these factors.

### Low-Level Question
**In the context of distributed databases, how do propagation strategies influence the efficiency and reliability of recovery processes across multiple nodes?**

*Guidance:* Examine the role of propagation strategies in ensuring consistent state across distributed components. Analyze the trade-offs between different strategies in terms of performance and fault tolerance.
