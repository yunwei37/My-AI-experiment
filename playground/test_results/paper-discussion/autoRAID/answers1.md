### Contemporary Relevance of the HP AutoRAID System

#### Evaluating Modern Comparisons

The **HP AutoRAID system**, a development of the late 1990s, was a pioneering solution in the realm of hierarchical storage management. It uniquely provided data redundancy with performance nearly on par with non-redundant arrays — a noteworthy accomplishment at the time. Given the rapid advancements in storage technologies since then, evaluating its contemporary relevance is both insightful and necessary.

**Comparison to Modern Systems:**
Modern hierarchical storage systems, such as those powered by cloud computing and software-defined solutions, have significantly diverged into sophisticated territories. The HP AutoRAID's emphasis on a software-based approach for attaining cost efficiency finds echoes today in storage systems that emphasize flexibility, scalability, and management ease through agile, software-driven processes. Nevertheless, HP AutoRAID's architecture might seem rudimentary compared to the dynamic provisioning and tiering observed in today's systems. 

Today’s storage needs emphasize speed (leveraging SSDs), reliability, and seamless data management, thereby necessitating a re-examination of HP AutoRAID’s principles. Storage solutions like OpenStack Swift or Amazon S3 leverage distributed architectures, introducing redundancy at a software layer similar to AutoRAID but on a vastly more network-integrated scale.

#### Potential Integrations and Improvements

To integrate or improve upon HP AutoRAID's principles with modern technology, the following avenues could be explored:

1. **Leverage Modern Hardware Innovations**: Incorporating NVMe drives can significantly reduce latency, outperforming traditional HDD RAID configurations. HP AutoRAID’s existing software-based structure would need an update to effectively utilize such technologies.

2. **Enhanced Data Management Algorithms**: Today’s AI and machine learning algorithms can be embraced to predictively manage data distribution across various storage tiers, optimizing performance dynamically beyond traditional RAID's static paradigms.

3. **Embracing Cloud-First Architectures**: Integrating HP AutoRAID principles with cloud-native design strategies could offer hybrid solutions that balance local and remote data redundancy needs.

4. **Utilizing Blockchain for Data Integrity**: To enhance data integrity further, blockchain technologies could oversee redundancy checks, ensuring every segment's veracity while maintaining data authenticity and facilitating audit trails.

5. **Security Enhancements**: Modern-day concerns around data security would necessitate integrating advanced encryption and access controls within any evolved AutoRAID systems.

To summarize, the HP AutoRAID system, while innovative for its time, holds foundational strategies that could be enhanced and adapted to today’s ever-evolving storage demands. By aligning its principles with cutting-edge hardware innovations and contemporary software advancements, an evolved form of AutoRAID could suit today’s cloud-centric, data-driven world.
