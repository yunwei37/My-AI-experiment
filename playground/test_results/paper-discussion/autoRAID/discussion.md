1. **Performance Evaluation**: How does the HP AutoRAID system achieve close performance to non-redundant disk arrays despite providing full data redundancy? What specific techniques or algorithms contribute to this performance improvement, and how do they compare to other storage solutions available today?

2. **Cost Efficiency**: The HP AutoRAID system claims to provide significant performance benefits with minimal additional hardware costs. How does the system's predominantly software-based implementation help achieve this cost efficiency? Can we identify any trade-offs involved?

3. **Adaptability Challenges**: The paper mentions that HP AutoRAID can adapt to many real-life environments despite some limitations. What are the specific types of workloads or environments where AutoRAID may struggle, and what are possible ways to mitigate these issues in practice?

4. **Maintenance and Usability**: Considering the ease of use highlighted in the paper, what are the potential challenges in maintaining the HP AutoRAID system? How might these challenges affect its suitability for certain industries or applications?

5. **Contemporary Relevance**: Given the advancements in storage technologies since the late 1990s, how do the principles and techniques used in HP AutoRAID compare to modern hierarchical storage systems? In what ways could they be integrated or improved upon with current technologies?

These questions are designed to stimulate critical thinking and enable students to relate the paper's findings with current trends and technologies in hierarchical storage systems. The discussion will focus on evaluating the core contributions of the system, understanding its practical applications and limitations, and dissecting its implications within both historical and contemporary contexts.
