1. **Key Sentences Supporting the Main Argument:**
   - "Perhaps the most important achievement of UNIX is to demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in human effort: UNIX can run on hardware costing as little as $40,000, and less than two man years were spent on the main system software." (Section 1, Introduction)

2. **Key Sentences Supporting Novel Ideas or Insights:**
   - "The special files are the most unusual feature of the UNIX file system. Each I/O device supported by UNIX is associated with at least one such file." (Section 3.3, Special Files)

3. **Key Sentences Supporting Methodology Used:**
   - "Besides the system proper, the major programs available under UNIX are: assembler, text editor based on QED, linking loader, symbolic debugger, compiler for a language resembling BCPL (C),... All of these programs were written locally." (Section 1, Introduction)

4. **Key Sentences Supporting Results Obtained:**
   - "To provide an indication of the overall efficiency of UNIX and of the file system in particular, timings were made of the assembly of a 7621-line program... The total clock time was 35.9 sec, for a rate of 212 lines per sec." (Section 4.1, Efficiency of the File System)

5. **Key Sentences Supporting Key Findings:**
   - "Nearly from the start, the system was able to, and did, maintain itself. This fact is more important than it might seem." (Section 8. Perspective)

6. **Interesting or Insightful Sentences:**
   - "Processes may communicate with related processes using the same system read and write calls that are used for file system I/O." (Section 5.2, Pipes)
   - "The success of UNIX lies not so much in new inventions but rather in the full exploitation of a carefully selected set of fertile ideas." (Section 8.1, Influences)

The paper highlights UNIX's ability to provide a multi-user interactive environment efficiently, with innovations like the treatment of devices as files and its process management through pipes and shells. The self-supporting nature of UNIX and its adaptability are considered among its significant achievements.
