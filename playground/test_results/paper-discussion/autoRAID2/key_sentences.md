Certainly! Below is a curated list of key sentences from the "Storage System" paper by John Wilkes et al., categorized to support various aspects of the paper's main topics and findings. Each sentence includes the page number and section where it is located.

### 1. **Main Argument of the Paper**
- **Abstract, Page 109, Section 1**
  - *"We present a solution to this problem: a two-level storage hierarchy implemented inside a single disk-array controller."*
  
- **Abstract, Page 109, Section 1**
  - *"The result is a fully redundant storage system that is extremely easy to use, is suitable for a wide variety of workloads, is largely insensitive to dynamic workload changes, and performs much better than disk arrays with comparable numbers of spindles and much larger amounts of front-end RAM cache."*

### 2. **Most Interesting, Novel Ideas or Insights**
- **Section 1.1, Page 110**
  - *"The basic idea is to combine the performance advantages of mirroring with the cost-capacity benefits of RAID 5 by mirroring active data and storing relatively inactive or read-only data in RAID 5."*

- **Section 1.2, Page 113**
  - *"Log-Structured RAID 5 Writes... HP AutoRAID avoids this overhead in most cases by writing to its RAID 5 storage in a log-structured fashion—that is, only empty areas of disk are written to, so no old-data or old-parity reads are required."*

- **Section 1.2, Page 113**
  - *"Active Hot Spare. The spare space needed to perform a reconstruction can be spread across all of the disks and used to increase the amount of space for mirrored data—and thus the array’s performance—rather than simply being left idle."*

- **Section 1.3, Page 115**
  - *"HP AutoRAID allows both data and parity to be relocated, and it uses the distributed spare capacity to increase the fraction of data held in mirrored form, thereby improving performance still further."*

### 4. **Methodology Used**
- **Section 3, Page 123**
  - *"A combination of prototyping and event-driven simulation was used in the development of HP AutoRAID."*

- **Section 4, Page 126**
  - *"Our simulator is built on the Pantheon [Cao et al. 1994; Gelding et al. 1994] simulation framework, which is a detailed, trace-driven simulation environment written in C++."*

### 5. **Results Obtained**
- **Section 3.2.1, Page 126**
  - *"Figure 6(a) shows the result: HP AutoRAID significantly outperforms the RAID array and has performance about three-fourths that of JBOD-LVM."*

- **Section 3.2.2, Page 127**
  - *"Figure 7 shows the relative performance of the two arrays and JBOD for random and sequential reads and writes."*

- **Section 4.4, Page 130**
  - *"By using shortest queue as a simple load-balancing heuristic, performance is improved by an average of 3.3% over random for these workloads."*

### 6. **Key Findings**
- **Section 5. Summary, Page 132**
  - *"The HP AutoRAID technology works extremely well, providing performance close to that of a nonredundant disk array across many workloads."*

- **Section 5, Page 132**
  - *"At the same time, it provides full data redundancy and can tolerate failures of any single array component."*

### **Additional Important and Insightful Sentences**
- **Section 5, Page 132**
  - *"It is very easy to use: one of the authors of this article was delivered a system without manuals a day before a demonstration and had it running a trial benchmark five minutes later."*

- **Section 3.2.3, Page 128**
  - *"HP AutoRAID detects it and reverts to a mode in which it writes directly to RAID 5—that is, it automatically adjusts its behavior so that performance is no worse than that of RAID 5."*

- **Section 2.1, Page 111**
  - *"The array presents one or more SCSI logical units (LUNS) to its hosts. Each of these is treated as a virtual device inside the array controller: their storage is freely intermingled."*

- **Section 4.6, Page 133**
  - *"Allowing overwrites had a noticeable impact on most of the workloads. It had a huge impact on the OLTP-log workload, improving its performance by a factor of 5.3."*

- **Section 2.4.1, Page 121**
  - *"Compaction: Cleaning and Hole-Plugging... If the RAID 5 PEG containing the holes is almost full, the array performs hole-plugging garbage collection, RBs are copied from a PEG with a small number of RBs and used to fill in the holes of an almost full PEG."*

- **Section 1.1, Page 110**
  - *"Studies on I/O access patterns, disk shuffling, and file system restructuring have shown that these conditions are often met in practice."*

### **Summary**
These key sentences collectively support the main argument, highlight novel ideas, describe the methodology, present the results, and underscore the key findings of the HP AutoRAID technology as detailed in the paper. Additionally, the insightful sentences provide a deeper understanding of the system's usability, adaptability, and practical benefits.
