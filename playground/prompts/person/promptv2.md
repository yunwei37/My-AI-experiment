**Task Overview:**

We are enhancing the comprehensive prompt to instruct individuals to craft detailed personal backgrounds, experiences, and stories for fictional new graduate students in computer science. To increase diversity and richness in the content, we are introducing additional control variables such as academic performance level, family background, grades, personality traits, and more. These variables will allow for a wider range of narratives that reflect various personal circumstances and experiences.
