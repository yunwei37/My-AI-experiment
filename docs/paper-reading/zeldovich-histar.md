## Introduction

Modern operating systems like Linux and Windows have become increasingly complex, with vast amounts of code running at various privilege levels. This complexity inherently introduces vulnerabilities, as evidenced by numerous high-profile security breaches. The paper introduces **HiStar**, a novel operating system designed to "minimize the amount of code that must be trusted" by enforcing strict information flow control. HiStar aims to "allow users to specify precise data security policies without unduly limiting the structure of applications," offering a secure and performant Unix-like environment.

## Background: Information Flow Control and Security

**Information Flow Control (IFC)** is a security paradigm that regulates how information moves within a system to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage. Traditional operating systems implement security through mechanisms like user permissions and access control lists (ACLs). However, these systems often rely on a significant amount of trusted code, increasing the attack surface.

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** and **Capability Systems** are two key frameworks in this domain. MAC enforces security policies uniformly across all subjects and objects, while capability systems use tokens or keys to grant specific access rights. HiStar builds upon these concepts, introducing a more granular and explicit control over information flows, aiming to reduce reliance on trusted code components.

## HiStar: Architecture and Core Features

HiStar's architecture is meticulously designed to enforce security through explicit control of information flows, minimizing trust dependencies. The system introduces several innovative concepts, including containers, taint labels, and a streamlined kernel design.

### Information Flow Control

At the heart of HiStar's security model is **strict information flow control**. The paper states:

> "HiStar enforces security by controlling how information flows through the system. Hence, one can reason about which components of a system may affect which others and how, without having to understand those components themselves."

This approach allows developers and administrators to define precise policies governing data movement, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access or manipulation.

### Containers and Taint Labels

HiStar introduces the concept of **containers**—hierarchical abstractions that manage object allocations and enforce quotas. Each object in the system possesses a **taint label**, a pivotal feature that dictates its level of trust and access permissions.

From the paper:

> "A label specifies, for each category of taint, whether the object has untainting privileges for that category and how tainted the object is in that category."

This labeling mechanism allows HiStar to track and control the flow of information across different system components meticulously. For instance, in the **virus scanner example**, the scanner's output is managed through a wrapper program that ensures data integrity without risking data leakage:

> "HiStar provides hierarchical control over object allocation and deallocation through a container abstraction."

### Kernel Design

The **HiStar kernel** is intentionally designed to be minimalistic and highly secure. Comprising approximately 15,200 lines of C code and 150 lines of assembly, the kernel emphasizes simplicity and verifiability.

Key points from the paper include:

- **Single-Level Store**: Unlike traditional systems that differentiate between kernel and user space, HiStar employs a single-level store approach, simplifying memory management and enhancing security.
- **Gate Mechanism**: Gates in HiStar act as protected control transfers, facilitating secure inter-process communications (IPC) without exposing internal system calls.
- **Taint Levels**: The kernel manages taint levels using a lattice-based approach, ensuring that information flows adhere to defined security policies.

## Applications of HiStar

HiStar's architecture is versatile, enabling secure implementations of various applications that are typically vulnerable in conventional operating systems.

### Untrusted Virus Scanner

One of the standout applications highlighted in the paper is the implementation of an **untrusted virus scanner**. Traditional virus scanners like ClamAV contain extensive codebases, making them susceptible to vulnerabilities. HiStar addresses this by isolating the scanner in an untrusted environment:

> "ClamAV’s vulnerabilities could periodically be updated on short notice to counter new threats, in which case users would face the unfortunate choice of running either an outdated virus scanner or an unaudited one."

By running the virus scanner in an isolated container with strict information flow policies, HiStar ensures that even if the scanner is compromised, the impact is contained, preventing data leaks or unauthorized data access.

### User Authentication

HiStar revolutionizes the user authentication process by removing the need for highly trusted processes. Instead of relying on superuser privileges to validate authentication requests, HiStar allows users to supply their own authentication services with minimal trust requirements.

From the paper:

> "HiStar authenticates users without any highly-trusted processes, and allows users to supply their own authentication services."

This decentralized approach enhances security by reducing the reliance on a central point of trust, making it harder for attackers to compromise the entire authentication system.

### VPN Isolation

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are critical for secure communications, but they often rely on firewalls and tunnel interfaces that can be compromised. HiStar's architecture offers robust VPN isolation by tracking the provenance of network data and enforcing strict information flow rules.

The paper illustrates:

> "In HiStar, the update process runs with the privilege to write the ClamAV executable and virus database; however, it cannot access private userdata."

This ensures that network data remains isolated, preventing malware or other threats from bridging the gap between secure and insecure network segments.

## Performance Benchmarks

A common critique of security-focused systems is the potential performance overhead. However, the paper on HiStar presents **benchmark results** demonstrating competitive performance relative to traditional operating systems like Linux and OpenBSD.

Key observations include:

- **IPC Benchmark**: HiStar performs better than Linux but is slightly slower than OpenBSD.
- **File Operations**: For small file operations, HiStar's performance is comparable to Linux, while large file operations show similar results between HiStar and Linux due to current implementation limitations.
- **Fork/Exec Benchmark**: HiStar exhibits slower performance in process creation compared to Linux and OpenBSD, attributed to the absence of certain optimizations like zero memory pages.

Despite these challenges, the paper emphasizes that HiStar's performance overhead is minimal and the system remains practical for real-world applications.

## Related Work

HiStar builds upon a rich history of research in secure operating systems and information flow control:

- **Asbestos**: The immediate predecessor to HiStar, Asbestos provided a foundation for explicit information flow control, which HiStar enhances by introducing decentralized tainting and user-level policy enforcement.
- **SELinux and EROS**: These systems implement MAC and capability-based security, respectively. HiStar differentiates itself by allowing fine-grained, application-specific policies without central administration.
- **Singularity**: Developed by Microsoft Research, Singularity focuses on reliability and security through a managed code environment. While similar in striving for minimal trusted code, HiStar offers a more flexible labeling system.

Unlike these systems, HiStar's emphasis on explicit information flow and minimal trusted code components sets it apart, offering a unique blend of security and performance.

## Limitations and Future Work

While HiStar presents a compelling security model, the paper acknowledges several **limitations**:

1. **Lack of Superuser**: HiStar operates without a traditional superuser role. Administrative tasks require secure, convention-based practices rather than inherent system privileges, which might complicate certain operations.
   
   > "HiStar has no superuser. A number of previous systems have limited, partitioned, or virtualized superuser privileges without an underlying operating system."

2. **Feature Gaps**: Certain functionalities common in Unix-like systems, such as tracking file access times or supporting POSIX capabilities, are either missing or require alternative implementations in HiStar.
   
   > "HiStar resembles Unix, but it also lacks several useful features and changes the semantics of some operations."

3. **Covert Channels**: Despite stringent information flow controls, HiStar is not immune to covert timing channels, which can be exploited to leak information indirectly.

   > "The network device is typically labeled {n3, nw0, i2,1}, where n and nw are owned by netd, and itaints category t). However, thetainted thread can make a tainted, i2,1} copy..."

The authors propose ongoing work to address these challenges, including enhancements to the authentication mechanisms, support for additional security features, and optimizations to improve performance further.
