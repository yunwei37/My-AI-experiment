## Understanding the Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels: A Deep Dive into a 1995 SIGMOD Paper

In the realm of database systems, ensuring data consistency and integrity amidst concurrent transactions is paramount. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) SQL-92 introduced standardized isolation levels to manage this concurrency. However, not all scholars and practitioners were satisfied with these definitions. In 1995, a seminal paper titled **"A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels"** by Hal Berenson, Phil Bernstein, Jim Gray, Jim Melton, Elizabeth O’Neil, and Patrick O’Neil challenged the adequacy of these standards. This blog post delves into the paper's core arguments, its analysis of existing isolation levels, and the proposed alternatives, providing a comprehensive overview for both seasoned database professionals and enthusiasts.

### **Publication Context**

Published in the proceedings of **SIGMOD '95** in San Jose, CA, this paper emerged at a time when database systems were grappling with the complexities of concurrency control. The mid-90s saw rapid advancements in database technologies, with increasing demands for higher performance and scalability. Amidst this backdrop, the authors sought to address perceived shortcomings in the ANSI SQL-92 standards, particularly concerning isolation levels—the mechanisms that dictate how transaction integrity is maintained in concurrent environments.

### **Abstract Breakdown**

The paper begins with an abstract that succinctly outlines its primary focus:

> *"The ANSI isolation levels are related to the behavior of leek phenomena: Dirty Reads, Non-Repeatable Reads, and Phantoms. Some leak schedulers allow transactions to peatable Reads, and Phantoms. This paper shows that these vary the scope and duration of their leak requests, thus redefining phenomena and the ANSI SQL definitions fail to properly partition from pure two-phase locking."*

At its core, the authors argue that ANSI SQL's isolation levels—**READ UNCOMMITTED**, **READ COMMITTED**, **REPEATABLE READ**, and **SERIALIZABLE**—are inadequately defined. They suggest that these definitions are ambiguous and do not effectively prevent certain anomalous behaviors that can arise during concurrent transactions.

### **Key Concepts Explained**

Before diving deeper, let's clarify some foundational concepts:

1. **Isolation Levels**: Dictate how transaction integrity is maintained when multiple transactions occur simultaneously. They define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in others.

2. **Anomalies**:
   - **Dirty Reads**: Occur when a transaction reads data written by another transaction that hasn't been committed yet.
   - **Non-Repeatable Reads**: Happen when a transaction reads the same data multiple times and finds inconsistencies due to updates from other transactions.
   - **Phantoms**: Arise when a transaction re-executes a query and finds rows that weren't previously visible due to additions or deletions by other transactions.
   - **Dirty Writes**: When two transactions attempt to write to the same data simultaneously, leading to potential data inconsistencies.

3. **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**: A concurrency control method that ensures serializability by acquiring all required locks before releasing any.

### **Detailed Analysis of the Paper**

#### **Introduction and Motivation**

The authors begin by highlighting ambiguities in the ANSI SQL-92 definitions:

> *"The three ANSI phenomena are ambiguous, and even in their loosest interpretations do not exclude some anomalous behavior that may arise in execution histories."*

This ambiguity leads to inconsistencies in how different database systems implement these isolation levels, resulting in unexpected and counterintuitive behaviors.

#### **Definition and Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels**

Section 2 of the paper introduces the basic terminology and defines the ANSI SQL isolation levels in terms of the aforementioned anomalies. The authors present a table summarizing these levels:

| Isolation Level      | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable Read | Phantom |
|----------------------|------------|---------------------|---------|
| **READ UNCOMMITTED** | Allowed    | Allowed             | Allowed |
| **READ COMMITTED**   | Not Allowed| Allowed             | Allowed |
| **REPEATABLE READ**  | Not Allowed| Not Allowed         | Allowed |
| **SERIALIZABLE**     | Not Allowed| Not Allowed         | Not Allowed |

The critique centers around the fact that while these definitions aim to prevent specific anomalies, they fail to account for others like **Dirty Writes** and **Lost Updates**. For instance, even at the highest isolation level, SERIALIZABLE, certain anomalies might still manifest if the definitions are not rigorous.

#### **Proposed Enhancements: Snapshot Isolation**

One of the paper's significant contributions is the introduction of **Snapshot Isolation**. Defined in Section 4, Snapshot Isolation is a multiversion concurrency control mechanism that allows transactions to work with a "snapshot" of the database at a particular moment. This approach aims to prevent common anomalies without the strict locking mechanisms of 2PL.

The authors note:

> *"Snapshot Isolation is non-serializable because a transaction’s Reads come at one instant and the Writes at another... This paper shows a number of weaknesses in the anomaly approach to defining isolation levels."*

Snapshot Isolation seeks to bridge the gap between performance and consistency by allowing greater concurrency while maintaining data integrity.

#### **Locking Isolation Levels vs. ANSI Definitions**

A critical part of the critique involves contrasting **Locking Isolation Levels** with ANSI's phenomena-based definitions. The authors argue that lock-based implementations of isolation levels are more precise and effective in preventing anomalies. They provide detailed comparisons, illustrating scenarios where ANSI definitions fall short.

For example, under **Locking READ COMMITTED**, the system holds write locks for the duration of the transaction, preventing other transactions from writing to the same data concurrently. This mechanism is more robust than merely prohibiting dirty reads, as it inherently prevents dirty writes and other anomalies.

#### **Introduction of New Phenomena**

Beyond challenging existing definitions, the paper introduces additional phenomena to capture scenarios not covered by ANSI SQL-92. These include:

- **Dirty Writes (PO)**: Where two transactions overwrite each other's data entries.
- **Lost Updates (P4)**: Occur when concurrent transactions write to the same data item, and one write overwrites the other without proper synchronization.

By defining these phenomena, the authors aim to provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing isolation levels that ensure data consistency.

#### **Cursor Stability and Its Implications**

The concept of **Cursor Stability** is explored as an alternative isolation mechanism. It ensures that only the currently active data item in a cursor is locked, allowing other transactions to access different data items concurrently. While this improves concurrency, it introduces complexities in maintaining overall data consistency, especially in systems with high transaction loads.

#### **Conclusion and Recommendations**

In their concluding remarks, the authors advocate for refining the ANSI SQL isolation levels by incorporating their proposed phenomena and mechanisms. They emphasize the necessity of precise definitions to prevent a broader range of anomalies, thereby enhancing the reliability of database systems.

> *"In summary, there are serious problems with the original ANSI SQL definition of isolation levels... We recommend that the isolation levels in Table 3 be strengthened to match the recommendation of Table 3."*

### **Implications and Legacy**

The critique presented in this paper has had lasting impacts on how database systems approach concurrency control. While ANSI SQL-92 laid the groundwork for standardized isolation levels, subsequent standards and implementations have continued to evolve these definitions, often incorporating insights from such scholarly critiques.

**Snapshot Isolation**, for instance, has become a staple in modern database systems like PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server, offering a balanced approach between performance and data consistency. The detailed analysis of anomalies beyond the original ANSI specifications has also influenced the development of more robust transaction management protocols.

### **Final Thoughts**

Understanding the nuances of isolation levels is crucial for database administrators and developers aiming to design reliable and efficient systems. The 1995 SIGMOD paper by Berenson et al. serves as a foundational critique that challenges us to think beyond established standards and continuously seek improvements in database concurrency control. As database technologies advance, revisiting such seminal works ensures that we build upon a solid framework of knowledge, addressing both existing challenges and emerging complexities in data management.
