## **1. Introduction to System R**

The journey of information storage in computers has witnessed numerous paradigms, but the shift towards the relational data model marked a transformative era. System R was constructed to *"demonstrate that the usability advantages of the relational data model can be realized in a system with the complete function and high performance required for everyday production use."* This objective, as articulated in the paper, set the foundation for what would become the standard for database systems.

### **Data Independence: A Cornerstone**

C.J. Date [27] defined data independence as *"immunity of applications to change in storage structure and access strategy."* System R epitomized this principle by providing a high-level user interface, allowing users to interact with data based on its logical structure rather than its physical representation. This abstraction is vividly illustrated in the paper's comparison between traditional "navigational" databases and relational systems.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“a navigational system has to deal with the various bits, pointers, arrays, lists, etc., which are representation for the information; connections between records, such as links, chains, parents, etc. For example, the fact that supplier Acme supplies bolts is represented by two important properties: (1) all information is represented by data values, never by any sort of 'connections' which are visible to the user; (2) the system supports a very high-level language in which users can frame requests for data without specifying algorithms for processing the requests.”*

This distinction between navigational and relational models underscores the shift towards greater user productivity and data adaptability.

## **2. Architectural Phases of System R**

The System R project was meticulously structured into three principal phases, each contributing uniquely to its evolution.

### **Phase Zero: Laying the Groundwork**

Phase Zero, spanning from 1974 to most of 1975, focused on developing an initial prototype and gathering insights to inform the complete System R version. An essential component developed during this phase was the Structured Query Language (SQL), initially known as SEQUEL. The phase also emphasized the design of optimizer algorithms aimed at minimizing the *"number of tuples fetched from the database."*

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“The Phase Zero optimizer cost measure should be a weighted sum of CPU time and I/O count, with weights adjustable according to the system configuration.”*

This phase revealed critical lessons, particularly regarding access path selection and the significance of clustering related data to optimize I/O operations.

### **Phase One: Building the Multiuser Prototype**

Conducted throughout 1976 and 1977, Phase One involved designing and constructing a full-function, multiuser version of System R. This phase introduced the Research Storage System (RSS) and the Relational Data System (RDS), which were integral in handling data storage, access, and authorization. The multiuser prototype incorporated mechanisms to prevent conflicts in concurrent data access, significantly enhancing system robustness.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“Unlike XRM, the Research Storage System implementation placed greater emphasis toward complex SQL statements while care was taken to preserve the original grant and authorization subsystems.”*

### **Phase Two: Evaluation and Refinement**

Spanning 1978 and 1979, Phase Two centered on evaluating System R in real-world environments at the San Jose Research Laboratory and selected customer sites. This phase scrutinized system performance, usability, and adaptability, leading to further refinements based on user feedback and experimental data.

## **3. The SQL Language: Bridging Users and Data**

A pivotal contribution of System R was the development and implementation of SQL, a high-level language that allowed users to perform complex data manipulations without delving into the underlying algorithms.

### **SQL's High-Level Interface**

The paper underscores SQL's ability to *"support all of the above" principles* by enabling users to define and manipulate data through straightforward queries. For instance, consider the query:

```sql
SELECT MIN(PRICE)
FROM PRICES
WHERE PARTNO IN (SELECT PARTNO FROM PARTS WHERE NAME = 'BOLT');
```

This query epitomizes SQL's declarative nature, where users specify *"what"* they want rather than *"how"* to retrieve it. The optimizer in System R interprets this high-level request and determines the most efficient execution path.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“In a navigational system, the burden (or opportunity) to specify exactly how the query is to be stored in the database, and the user's algorithm is written.”*

### **Enhancements and User Experience**

System R's SQL was designed for simplicity and power. Features like the "EXISTS" predicate and the "LIKE" operator were introduced to handle complex search patterns and dynamic query executions. Users praised SQL for its uniformity and ease of adoption, highlighting its ability to facilitate rapid application development.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“Users consistently praised the uniformity of the SQL syntax across the environments of application programs, ad hoc query, and data definition.”*

## **4. Query Optimization and Access Path Selection**

One of System R's most significant innovations was its approach to query optimization. The optimizer aimed to *"minimize the weighted sum of the predicted number of I/Os and RSS calls in processing an SQL statement."* This strategy ensured that queries were executed efficiently, balancing CPU usage with disk I/O operations.

### **Optimizer Algorithms**

The optimizer navigates through a tree of path choices, estimating costs associated with each potential access path. For example, in handling a query to find the lowest price for bolts, the optimizer might evaluate scanning an index versus performing a full table scan, selecting the most cost-effective method based on data distribution and index efficiency.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“The System R optimizer algorithms are described more fully in [47]. The key objective of the recovery subsystem is provision of a means whereby the database may be restored to a consistent state in the event of a hardware or software failure.”*

### **Experimentation and Findings**

Experiments showcased the optimizer's effectiveness in selecting efficient access paths, although some discrepancies between predicted and actual costs were noted. These were often attributed to the optimizer's assumptions about data clustering and distribution.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“Although the optimizer was able to correctly order the access paths in the experiment we have just described, the magnitudes of the predicted costs differed from the measured costs in several cases.”*

## **5. Concurrency Control and Locking Mechanisms**

Ensuring data integrity in a multiuser environment was paramount. System R introduced sophisticated locking mechanisms to manage concurrent data access without sacrificing performance.

### **Locking Subsystem**

The locking subsystem utilized *"exclusive" locks* for record updates, ensuring that no two users could modify the same data simultaneously. The design deliberated on "predicate locks," but challenges in determining mutual satisfiability led to their eventual abandonment in favor of more granular record-level locking.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“The locking subsystem ensures that each data value is accessed by only one user at a time, that all updates made by a given transaction become effective simultaneously, and that deadlocks between transactions are detected and resolved.”*

### **The Convoy Phenomenon**

A notable challenge encountered was the "convoy phenomenon," where processes queued for a high-traffic lock experienced delays, leading to system thrashing. Implementing strict lock release protocols mitigated this issue, ensuring smoother concurrent operations.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“Experiments with the locking subsystem of System R identified a problem which came to be known as the 'convoy phenomenon.'”*

## **6. Recovery Mechanisms**

System R's robustness was further enhanced by its comprehensive recovery subsystem, which ensured data consistency and integrity in the face of failures.

### **Shadow Pages and Logging**

The system maintained "shadow pages" for each updated page and employed a logging mechanism to track changes. In the event of a failure, System R could utilize these logs to either redo committed transactions or undo incomplete ones, guaranteeing a consistent database state.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“When a system failure occurs, an image dump of the database plus a log of 'before' and 'after' changes provide the alternate copy which makes recovery... possible.”*

### **Checkpointing**

Periodic checkpoints were introduced to streamline recovery processes. By forcing updates to disk at intervals, the system minimized data loss and expedited recovery operations.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“Periodically during normal operation, a 'checkpoint' occurs in which all locks and not yet reflected on disk are written out in a new place on disk, and the original page is retained.”*

## **7. Views and Authorization**

System R offered advanced features for defining data views and managing user authorizations, crucial for maintaining data security and customized data access.

### **Defining Views**

Views in System R allowed users to create virtual tables based on queries, enabling tailored data representations without altering the underlying data structures.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“We wanted to allow any SQL query to be used as the definition of a view. This was accomplished by storing complete view definitions in the form of three basic actions: the change log backwards removing all changes made by the transaction.”*

### **Authorization Mechanism**

The authorization subsystem controlled user privileges, ensuring that users could only access or modify data within their assigned permissions. This mechanism was seamlessly integrated with the view system, providing a robust security framework.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“The view subsystem permits users to define alternative views of the database without disturbing users' existing applications.”*

## **8. Performance Evaluation**

The paper details extensive performance evaluations conducted during Phase Two, illustrating System R's capabilities and areas for improvement.

### **Compilation vs. Interpretation**

One of the critical evaluations compared the performance of compiled SQL statements against an interpretive approach. The findings revealed that System R's compilation method *"was clearly comparable to the feasibility of applying a relational database system to a real production environment."*

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“...it would be the high-level SQL, into machine-level code. The result of this compilation technique from E. F. Codd, whose landmark paper, the following people were associated with System R and made important contributions to its development has already been implemented and others are still under study.”*

### **Optimizer Efficiency**

The optimizer demonstrated commendable efficiency in predicting and selecting access paths, although real-world data patterns occasionally challenged its assumptions.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“Because System R records with the indexed values would still be in the system buffers, the importance of clustering, mechanisms were provided for loading data in value order and preserving the value ordering when new records are inserted into the database.”*

---

## **9. Conclusions and Legacy**

The paper concludes by affirming that System R successfully illustrated the practical applicability of the relational data model, balancing user-friendly interfaces with backend efficiency. Its innovations laid the groundwork for modern relational databases, with SQL becoming the de facto standard for database querying and management.

### **Impact on Future Systems**

System R's architectural and conceptual advancements influenced subsequent database systems, including IBM's own DB2 and Oracle's offerings. The emphasis on data independence, robust concurrency control, and sophisticated query optimization remains integral to contemporary database management.

> **Original Excerpt:**  
> *“System R has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of applying a relational database system to a real production environment in which many concurrent users are performing a mixture of ad hoc queries and repetitive transactions.”*
