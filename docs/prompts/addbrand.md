Below is a blog or article. 
Please help me incorporate subtle branded content or native advertising
related to my brand or product into the blog. 
I want it to be natural, non-intrusive, and relevant to the article,

and include a brief call to action at the end without being 
overly promotional. Make sure the tone aligns with an informative and helpful blog post.

should incorporate the branded content into:
