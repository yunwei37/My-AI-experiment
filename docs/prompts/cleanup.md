I have a text file containing content extracted from a PDF of an academic paper. 

Please perform the following tasks to make it more human-readable:

1. **Identify and Extract the Title:**
   - Locate the title of the paper and place it on the first line of the output.

2. **Clean Up the Content:**
   - Remove any irrelevant characters, artifacts, or formatting issues resulting from the PDF extraction (e.g., page numbers, headers, footers, line breaks within paragraphs).
   - Correct any obvious typos or formatting inconsistencies to enhance readability.

3. **Organize the Content:**
   - Ensure that the main body of the text follows the title.
   - Maintain proper paragraph structures and headings as appropriate.

4. **Enhance Readability:**
   - Reformat sections, subsections, and lists to improve clarity.
   - Ensure consistent font styles and sizes if applicable (e.g., bold for headings).

Give me only the cleaned up result content. The cleaned up result content should content all the text, do not miss any results or text. 
It shoud be as detail as possible, especially mind the numbers and results.

The raw content is follow:
