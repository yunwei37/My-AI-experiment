## what can I generate

As a new graduate student in computer science, building an online presence and personal brand is important for your career and networking opportunities. Here are some steps to get started:

### Accounts to Build
1. **GitHub/GitLab**: 
   - Share your projects, code, and contributions. Regularly update your repositories with open-source contributions, research projects, and personal coding initiatives. You can host technical blogs or tutorials as well.
   - Make sure to organize your repositories well, and write clear READMEs that explain your work concisely.

2. **LinkedIn**:
   - Create a well-rounded profile that highlights your skills, academic background, and experience. Post about projects you're working on, events you're attending, and connect with other professionals in your field.
   - Ask for recommendations and endorsements from professors or colleagues on relevant skills.

3. **Personal Website**:
   - A personal website acts as a portfolio to showcase your projects, research, blog posts, and professional background. Use it to introduce yourself, link to your social media and GitHub profiles, and publish blogs on topics you're passionate about.
   - Use platforms like GitHub Pages, WordPress, or a simple static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo to build the site.

4. **ResearchGate/Google Scholar**:
   - If you're working on academic papers or research, use these platforms to share your work, connect with other researchers, and follow relevant discussions.
   
5. **Twitter/X and Mastodon (Optional)**:
   - Engage with the tech and academic community by sharing articles, discussing current trends, and networking with industry professionals.

### Key Idea of Telling a Story Around Yourself
The key to creating a strong personal narrative is authenticity. Here's how to craft a compelling story:

1. **Background and Passion**:
   - Start by sharing your journey into computer science. Explain what drives you—whether it’s a personal interest in problem-solving, an impactful project, or a fascination with how systems work.
   
2. **Skills and Experiences**:
   - Highlight key experiences that helped you grow. This could be internships, research projects, or contributions to open-source communities. Focus on how these experiences shaped your skillset and how you’ve applied what you learned.

3. **Core Values**:
   - What values drive your work? Whether it’s collaboration, curiosity, or a commitment to advancing technology, make sure to weave these values into your narrative.

4. **Aspirations**:
   - Clearly state where you want to go. For example, do you aim to work in artificial intelligence, open-source development, or system security? Express what you hope to accomplish, and align it with the projects or skills you're currently working on.

5. **Differentiators**:
   - Show what makes you unique. Do you have a specific perspective on a problem, a project that stands out, or interdisciplinary experience? Bring out these unique aspects to stand apart from the crowd.

By blending these elements, you can tell a cohesive story about your journey, strengths, and future goals that resonate with employers, collaborators, or mentors.

## story depth

When telling and forming your story, you should focus on clarity, consistency, and relevance. Here are key points to remember when shaping your narrative:

### 1. **Define Your Core Message**
   - **Who you are**: What are your main skills and experiences? What defines your journey in computer science?
   - **What you’re passionate about**: What problems do you want to solve or what areas excite you the most (e.g., systems, AI, eBPF, LLMs)?
   - **What you want to achieve**: What are your career goals and aspirations?

### 2. **Be Authentic**
   - Present your real self, including your strengths, learning moments, and growth points. Avoid exaggerating experiences; people relate more to authentic stories.
   - Share both successes and challenges you've overcome to show resilience and problem-solving abilities.

### 3. **Focus on Impact**
   - Highlight the impact of your work or contributions, not just the tasks you completed. How did your project improve a system? What changes did your contributions bring to a community?
   - Demonstrate real-world applications of your work to show potential employers or collaborators what you can offer.

### 4. **Structure Your Story Well**
   - **Start with a hook**: Begin with something memorable—like the moment that sparked your interest in tech or a challenge that pushed your skills to the next level.
   - **Middle (building the story)**: Describe key experiences, projects, and learning milestones. Show progression in skills and knowledge.
   - **Conclusion**: End with where you're headed next, your aspirations, and what you want to achieve in the future.

### 5. **Tailor Your Story for Different Contexts**
   - **Interviews**: Focus on professional accomplishments, projects, and how your background fits the job you’re applying for.
   - **Networking events**: Highlight common interests and goals, and keep the conversation approachable.
   - **Personal website**: Your about page can be a more holistic story—include personal interests, research, and professional work.

### Documents That Can Help People Understand You
1. **Personal Website (Portfolio)**:
   - Acts as a central hub to showcase your background, projects, research, and professional goals.
   - Can include sections like an “About Me” page, project portfolio, and blog posts on topics you're passionate about.

2. **Resume/CV**:
   - Keep it concise but impactful. Highlight key experiences, skills, and relevant projects. Tailor it to the specific industry or academic role you're aiming for.

3. **GitHub Profile/README**:
   - A README in your GitHub profile can act like an introduction to who you are and what you work on. It’s another place to showcase your skills, ongoing work, and open-source contributions.

4. **LinkedIn Summary**:
   - This is a great place for a concise version of your story. Include a few sentences about your professional journey, key skills, and what you’re looking for in the next step of your career.

5. **Personal Statement**:
   - Especially in academia, a well-written personal statement can capture your motivations, academic interests, and long-term goals in a way that complements your CV.

6. **Research Portfolio/Annotated Bibliography**:
   - If you’re focused on academic or research roles, providing a well-organized research portfolio or a list of papers and projects you’ve worked on can help people understand your academic depth.

### General Tips:
   - **Be consistent**: Ensure your story across platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, website, etc.) is aligned and tells a coherent narrative.
   - **Visual aids**: Use diagrams, project screenshots, or videos on your personal website to make your story more engaging.
   - **Contextualize**: Always place your work in context—explain why it matters and what problem it solves.

By keeping these points in mind, you can craft a narrative that is engaging, authentic, and tailored to the audience you want to reach.
