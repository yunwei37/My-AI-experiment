# Prompt Engineering is Dead, Long Live AI Engineering

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about prompt engineering and its future. Remember when crafting the perfect prompt was the secret sauce to getting the best responses from AI? People spent hours tweaking their words, trying to get the AI to understand exactly what they wanted. But things are changing, and here's why.

A recent discussion on Hacker News got me thinking. People were saying things like, "Prompts aren't a science. There's no real method to them." And you know what? They might be right. With the latest AI models, like OpenAI's new "o1" model, the need for complicated prompts is fading. These models are getting smarter and can handle simple, clear instructions much better than before.

So, what's really important now? It’s not just about the prompts anymore. It's about how we **input** our thoughts and **interact** with AI. Prompt engineering is just one part of a bigger picture. The key is to put how you think and how you solve problems into the system you build. This isn't just about computer systems. Think about multi-agent systems or even human society—these are all systems too.

OpenAI's new "o1" model even suggests some changes in how we structure prompts for better performance:

1. **Keep prompts simple and direct:** Models work best with brief and clear instructions. You don't need to guide them too much.
2. **Avoid chain-of-thought prompts:** There's no need to ask the model to "think step by step" or explain its reasoning. It can handle reasoning internally.
3. **Use delimiters for clarity:** Adding things like triple quotes or XML tags helps the model understand different parts of your input.
4. **Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Only include the most relevant information to keep the model's response focused.

These tips show that while prompt engineering isn't useless, its role is changing. Instead of focusing on crafting detailed prompts, we should focus on building systems that leverage these smarter AI models effectively.

Another interesting point from the discussion is that both OpenAI's "o1" model and Anthropic's Claude can now generate the best prompts for your tasks. This means the AI itself can help create the prompts you need, making the process even simpler.

In the real world, building AI applications shows just how much prompt engineering matters. If you spend a lot of time creating an application to achieve a real goal, you'll see that prompts make a huge difference. It takes a lot of fiddly, annoying work to get them right. For example, in financial markets, building an AI agent system was more straightforward than perfecting each prompt. People even build systems just to iterate on prompts, like [PromptLayer](https://www.promptlayer.com/).

Using AI agents and managing workflows makes AI applications much more complex. It's not just about asking a question and getting an answer. It's about creating a whole system that can handle different tasks, remember context, and improve over time. This shift shows that AI engineering—building these complex systems—is becoming more important than ever.

Let’s break it down from different perspectives:

**From an AI Researcher’s View:**

AI models have advanced so much that they can handle direct prompts effectively. The focus is now on creating complex systems, like AI agents, that can perform tasks on their own. Researchers are exploring how models can use their own reasoning without needing detailed prompts. Systems that can remember, handle context, and improve themselves are becoming more important.

**From a Software Engineer’s View:**

The infrastructure around AI models is crucial. Building systems that work well with AI involves more than just prompts. It’s about creating scalable architectures, managing data flow, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. A good user experience comes from a seamless system, not just from well-crafted prompts.

**From a Business Strategist’s View:**

Relying only on prompt engineering won’t give a lasting edge. Building unique systems that reflect your company’s problem-solving methods can set you apart. Investing in system development, creating intellectual property, and forming strategic partnerships add real value. Understanding what the market needs and tailoring your systems accordingly is more impactful than just focusing on prompts.

**From a Cognitive Scientist’s View:**

Human thinking is complex and involves more than just simple inputs. AI systems should aim to mimic this holistic thinking rather than rely on scripted prompts. Studying how humans solve problems can help design AI systems that are more intuitive and effective. Features like context awareness and adaptability are key to making intelligent systems.

So, why is over-detailing prompts for simple tasks unnecessary? For one, advanced models have built-in mechanisms for reasoning and handling context. They don’t need exhaustive instructions to perform basic tasks. Simple prompts save time and reduce confusion for both the user and the AI. Clear and direct language helps avoid misunderstandings.

However, in complex tasks that need specific formats or detailed reasoning, some level of prompt engineering might still be needed. When you want creative or nuanced responses, additional context can help. But even then, it's just a part of building a larger, effective system.

In conclusion, while prompt engineering isn’t entirely dead, its role is changing. The spotlight is now on **AI engineering**—building strong systems that can understand and execute our intentions with minimal fuss. It’s about integrating our thinking and problem-solving processes into the AI’s design. This leads to more robust and effective AI applications, whether through agents, networks, or other system models.

For simple tasks, keeping prompts straightforward is enough. Overcomplicating them offers little benefit. The key is to understand what the AI can do and design systems that leverage these strengths to achieve your goals.

So, let's move beyond getting stuck on crafting the perfect prompt. Instead, let's focus on building systems that make the most of AI's capabilities. After all, the goal is to solve problems and create innovative solutions, not just to talk to machines.

**Long live AI engineering!**
