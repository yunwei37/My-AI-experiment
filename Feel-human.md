### How to Write a Blog Post That Feels More Human (Not AI) – Detailed Guide

Writing a blog post that feels human and engaging can be tricky in a world where AI-generated content is common. Readers can often spot overly formal or robotic writing, which makes them disconnect. If you want to create content that truly resonates with people, here’s a guide to help you write blog posts that sound natural and relatable. Plus, we’ll talk about the importance of building your writer role and branding a blog series, so that your writing has a distinct and recognizable identity.

### Key Strategies to Make Your Blog Posts More Human

1. **Use a Conversational Tone**
   Instead of using stiff or formal language, aim for a tone that feels like a conversation between you and your reader. Imagine explaining the topic to a friend or colleague. Use contractions, informal phrasing, and simple words to make it sound more like real speech.

   **Example:**
   - **AI-like:** "The implementation of these features is essential for the optimization of the system."
   - **Human-like:** "You’re going to love this feature—it makes everything so much easier and faster."

   Notice how the second example feels more relaxed and friendly, like a conversation.

2. **Share Personal Experiences or Stories**
   Adding a personal touch to your blog post makes it relatable. Share quick anecdotes or personal insights to show that you have experience with the topic. This humanizes your writing and makes it more engaging.

   **Example:**
   - **AI-like:** "This tool automates repetitive tasks, increasing productivity."
   - **Human-like:** "I used to waste hours doing this manually, but after trying this tool, it cut my work time in half!"

   By sharing your experience, you give readers something to connect with on a personal level.

3. **Use Clear, Simple Sentences**
   Long, complex sentences can confuse readers. Break your thoughts into smaller, digestible chunks. This not only helps with readability but also makes your message clearer.

   **Example:**
   - **AI-like:** "The successful implementation of the automation strategies is of paramount importance to optimizing workflows across the board."
   - **Human-like:** "These automation tips? They’ll save you so much time in your daily work. Try them, and you’ll see a difference."

   Simplicity makes your content more approachable and ensures readers can follow your ideas without effort.

4. **Relatable Analogies and Comparisons**
   Analogies or metaphors help readers understand complex ideas in simpler terms. They create a bridge between the unfamiliar and something the reader already knows, making the content more intuitive.

   **Example:**
   - **AI-like:** "Optimizing system resources leads to increased efficiency."
   - **Human-like:** "Think of it like upgrading your bike to a car—everything just moves faster when your system’s optimized."

   The analogy turns an abstract concept into something visual and relatable.

5. **Ask Questions and Use Light Humor**
   A good way to engage your audience is by asking questions that make them think or connect with the topic. Humor also lightens the tone and makes your post more enjoyable to read.

   **Example:**
   - **AI-like:** "Follow the installation steps carefully to ensure proper setup."
   - **Human-like:** "Ever tried skipping steps in an installation and ended up regretting it? Yeah, me too. Trust me, you’ll want to follow these steps."

   Questions make the post feel interactive, and humor breaks up the monotony of technical or serious content.

6. **Avoid Jargon and AI Buzzwords**
   Overusing technical terms or buzzwords, especially AI-related ones, can make your writing feel cold and distant. Stick to simple language unless you’re writing for a technical audience, and even then, explain things when necessary.

   **Example:**
   - **AI-like:** "This AI-powered solution is crucial for optimizing resource allocation."
   - **Human-like:** "This tool is a real time-saver. It figures out how to use your resources smarter—no fancy AI magic, just smart software."

   The simpler phrasing feels more human and down-to-earth.

### Why Building a Writer Role and Series Brand Is Important

When you’re writing a blog post or a series, establishing your **writer role** and creating a **series brand** can help you connect with your audience on a deeper level. This consistency encourages readers to return for more content because they recognize and trust your voice and your brand.

#### 1. **Building a Writer Role**
Creating a recognizable writer persona is key to making your content stand out. Whether you come across as an expert, a learner, or just someone who’s passionate about sharing knowledge, your role as a writer helps define your voice. This creates consistency and helps readers feel connected to you as a person, not just a faceless author.

##### Benefits:
- **Trust and Authority**: Readers are more likely to follow your work if they trust the person behind it. A consistent voice builds authority in your niche.
- **Engagement**: When your personality comes through, people are more likely to comment, share, or even return to read more.
- **Consistency**: A defined writer role ensures your tone, style, and approach stay consistent across your posts.

##### Example:
If you’re writing about eBPF:
- As an **expert**, your tone would focus on deep technical knowledge, offering solutions and best practices.
- As a **learner**, you might write about your journey of learning eBPF, sharing both successes and challenges.

#### 2. **Building a Series Brand**
Branding your blog series gives it an identity that readers can follow. A series brand not only helps with consistency but also creates anticipation for future posts. Readers are more likely to stick around and keep coming back when they know what to expect from a branded series.

##### Benefits:
- **Sets Expectations**: A strong brand for your series gives readers a clear idea of what each post will cover.
- **Loyal Following**: When readers follow a series, they’re more likely to become loyal, returning for each new post.
- **Organization**: A branded series makes your content easier to organize and access. Readers can follow along or revisit earlier posts in the series.
  
##### Example:
If your series is called **“eBPF for Beginners”**, each post in the series could explore a different aspect of eBPF, with each one building on the previous post. The series name and branding set the expectation that readers will learn about eBPF step-by-step.

2. **Create a Brand for Your Series**: Give your series a memorable name and a consistent structure. Let readers know what they can expect in each installment.
3. **Write with Clarity and Simplicity**: Use simple, conversational language, share personal stories, and make your writing relatable. Avoid jargon, ask questions, and have a little fun with humor.
